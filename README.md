# PACT Network OpenAPI Schema Definitions

This repository contains the [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org) schemas for the 
[Technical specifications for the PACT Network](https://github.com/wbcsd/data-exchange-protocol).

Based on this schema the [documentation and corresponding simplified data models](https://wbcsd.github.io/data-exchange-protocol/) will be generated.

They are originally based on the [demo-endpoint](https://github.com/wbcsd/demo-endpoint) by SINE and the [conformance test tool](https://github.com/mill6-plat6aux/pathfinder-testbed) by NRI.

## Version and format

[OpenAPI 3.1.0](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html) is being used, now fully compatible with JSON Schema. 
For readability and easier editing the files are in YAML format. The schema's are not autogenerated from
code (like sample implementations) but treated as standalone artefacts.

These schemas will be kept in sync as we release new versions of the specification. Currently
the following versions are available.

## Status
Current status is DRAFT. First complete version will accompany the PACT tech specs v2.3, ETA October 2024.
